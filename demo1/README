This is a basic sample for TNAPS that demonstrates transparent access to the components through HTTP. It consits of two components(calc and currency) and single application that uses TNAPS Host Provider built-in component for HTTP access.

	1. Requirements
	2. Compilation
	3. Deployment

1. Requirements
===============================
Installed TNAPS and TNAPS SDK. For more information about TNAPS requirements and installation, see README in TNAPS installation package.

2. Compilation and Installation
===============================

ON WINDOWS
	1. Open Windows Command Line (cmd.exe);
	2. Change dir to the directory with demo1 sample(for example, >cd D:\tnaps-samples\demo1);
	3. Assign installed TNAPS path to the 'tnaps' environment variable (>set tnaps="C:\Program Files\TNAPS");
	4. Execute make_sample.cmd on x86 machine, or make_sample_x64.cmd on x64 machine (>make_sample);

ON LINUX
	
	1. Open Terminal;
	2. Change dir to the directory with demo1 sample(for example, :cd ~/tnaps-samples/demo1);
	3. Assign installed TNAPS path to the 'TNAPS' environment variable(:export TNAPS=/opt/tnaps);
	4. Assign Mono path to the 'MONO' environment variable(:export MONO=/opt/mono);
	4. Execute make_sample.sh (:./make_sample.sh)

This workflow produces 'demo_app.tnpak' file that represents TNAPS Application Package.

NOTE: You can define a necessary environment variables once at machine level.

3. Deployment
===============================
Open Library in TNAPS console and install Application Package produced in the previous step.
