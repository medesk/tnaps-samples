    Demo application with two simple components. The first CALC component provides conversion between decimal number and its binary representation. The second CURRENCY
    component demonstrates accessing to Yahoo! REST API. These components are exposed to the Web through built-in Host Provider component.
    When you create an instance, you will be prompted to configure the instance. It is recommended to leave them by default. 
    After instance startup, you can use a browser to access to the example: http://localhost:8082/items/index.html. Enjoy!
